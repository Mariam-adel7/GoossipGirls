    <h4>"Where did this girl come from, where did she come from?"<br/><br/>
Around Catalonia, those incredulous words were heard every time Aitana Bonmati took to the pitch.
<br/><br/>In the early 2000s - an era when football pitches were often not seen as a place for girls - she defied stereotypes and scepticism from the beginning.
<br/>Oscar Gamez was her first coach, guiding her as a seven-year-old girl in a CD Ribes boys' team. He vividly recalls the post-match scenes, when parents from opposing teams would approach him in disbelief.
<br/><br/>"She was like a tsunami," Gamez told BBC Sport. <br/>"On the pitch, she was a force of nature. It was a sensation to see her play.
"She had an extra thing that the boys didn't have - this effervescence, this character of always wanting and wanting and wanting to go… that was the main difference."
<br/><br/>Bonmati was not just the only girl on her team; she was the only girl playing for CD Ribes as a whole. One club, with 400 boys and one girl.
<br/>"We know how boys can be, and at that time, they discriminated against her for being the only girl," Gamez said.<br/> <br/>"But I never had to mediate. Aitana had a very strong character and didn't let anyone trample over her."
<br/>Playing on rough pitches, Bonmati would throw herself into tackles, dust herself down and never complain.
Small-town scepticism quickly turned to awe.
<br/><br/>Bonmati's story isn't merely one of a girl who played football; it is a saga of mental strength, intensity, and a relentless desire that transcends generations.
From the dirt and grit of Ribes' proving grounds, Bonmati has risen to the pinnacle of women's football, yet the source of her energy and resilience stretches back, far beyond the pitch and even her own birth.
Rosa Bonmati, Aitana's mother, faced a form. And a decision.

<br/><br/>It was 1998. She had come to the civil registry to register her daughter's birth.
Spanish tradition, convention and legislation were unanimous. The surname of Rosa's father - Vincent Conca - must be the first of Aitana's two surnames. Bonmati would be retained as a name, but only on official documents. Aitana would be commonly known as Aitana Conca.
Rosa resisted.
<br/><br/>With Vincent's full endorsement, she put her own name - Bonmati - before her husband's.
<br/>When the bureaucracy wouldn't allow that, Rosa instead registered herself as a single mother, leaving Vincent's details off the form entirely, and giving Aitana only one surname, but an early example of standing up for what she believes in.
<br/><br/>Rosa left the registry but refused to let the issue lie. Together with politician Imma Mayol and a team of legal experts, she put forward a proposal to change the law to allow parents to ascribe their children's' surnames in any order.
<br/><br/><img src="images/Topic 1.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br/><br/>
It was passed at the end of 1999, a few months before Aitana's second birthday. Vincent's name was added to Aitana's official documents, but after Rosa's. She became Aitana Bonmati Conca, just as Rosa had always intended.
Vincent, like his wife, is committed to causes.
<br/><br/>As well as advocating for family rights, he is a campaigner in the Movement for the Defence of the Land (MDT), a coalition of socialist organisations pushing for the independence of Catalonia and other surrounding regions.
<br/><br/>"Rosa has always been a bit more impulsive, while Vincent is a bit more reflective and thoughtful and composed. The blend has given Aitana this way of being", her aunt Lili Bonmati told BBC Sport.
Aitana's upbringing was a peaceful one.
<br/>Nestled on the outskirts of Barcelona, Ribes is a tranquil village of about 30,000 residents.
<br/>In this idyllic spot, where the sound of children playing football echoes off the town square's stone buildings, Bonmati thrived.
For her parents, intellectual stimulation was more important than athletic passion.
<br/><br/>Both Rosa and Vincent taught Catalan language and literature and the family home resembled a quaint library, with every room adorned with books.
Guided by Rosa, Aitana would piece together puzzles as a toddler, building focus and concentration to go with her natural energy.
By then she had long since been in her own room. Her parents, keen to develop their daughter's independence, had taught her to sleep alone from the tender age of three months.
<br/><br/>The love of books is something that has been passed down through the generations, with Bonmati fascinated by philosophy, justice and history.
Her reading includes If This Is A Man and Man's Search for Meaning - Primo Levi and Viktor Frankl's accounts of their incarceration in Nazi-run concentration camps during the Second World War - and Heather Dune Macadam's The Nine Hundred, which details the story of a group of young women who were the first Jews to be taken by official transport to Auschwitz.
<br/><br/>Currently, she is engrossed in Open - Andre Agassi's 2009 autobiography - which charts the legendary tennis player's intense childhood and difficulties dealing with fame.
<br/><br/>Bonmati had tried swimming and basketball, but it was football that fit best, both for her and her family.

Her mother relished Bonmati's disregard for gender norms, while her father would fashion a ball from aluminium foil and take on his young daughter in high-spirited games in the kitchen.
As her passion developed, Bonmati would wear her Ribes football kit to family gatherings rather than a dress. And in her family, such freedom of expression was encouraged rather than challenged.
<br/><br/>Her first coach, Gamez, saw her fearless spirit and drew a comparison with charismatic Barcelona captain Carles Puyol. Starting as a defender, Bonmati's ability to steal the ball and initiate attacks showcased her strength on the pitch.
But as Gamez rotated her from defence to midfield, Bonmati's influence only grew, paving the way for her journey, 40 minutes east, from the serene village of Ribes to the noise and light of FC Barcelona.
<br/><br/>The move to Barcelona marked a substantial step up in the standard of football. Yet, there was not the same improvement in conditions off the pitch.
<br/><br/>After training, Bonmati and her Barcelona youth team-mates would make do with cold showers in makeshift changing rooms.
Gym sessions and tactical video analysis lectures, pivotal to developing their teenage minds and bodies for the professional game, never happened.
<br/><br/>And, while their male counterparts had the famed La Masia, Barcelona's female youth players had no similar on-site residential facility to help their training.
Instead, once their three-hour training sessions finished around midnight, Bonmati would watch her team-mates climb into family cars to head back to their distant hometowns, fighting off sleep to study schoolwork as they went.
And they were the lucky ones.
<br/><br/><img style="margin-left: 20px;" src="images/Topic 1-3.jpg" width="600" height="400"/><br/><br/>
Bonmati used to take public transport every day, first the bus and then the train, to be able to train with Barcelona. This was because her mother suffers from chronic pain condition fibromyalgia and was often unable to drive and her father had not passed his test.
It was a journey of 23 miles and more than an hour each way for Bonmati.
<br/><br/>"I was running so as not to miss the train home… I even wondered if it was worth all the effort," she admitted last year, thinking back to those days.
<br/><br/>"She got tired because it was tough," her aunt Lili said. "She was about to quit football in adolescence."
<br/>Aitana was 13 when her mother suggested that, as well as working hard towards her goals, she should also work on herself.
Bonmati started seeing a psychologist, focusing on accepting frustration as a normal part of achievement and the pursuit of excellence.
<br/>Some of the exercises that she learned, such as writing down her emotions to help ease their burden on her mind, she still practises today.
<br/><br/>Through these testing years, though, Bonmati's love of football never wavered. Former team-mate Carla Rivera vividly recalls Bonmati's relentless pursuit of improvement.
<br/><br/>"I recall her being extremely demanding of herself, obsessed with sport and driven to improve," Rivera told BBC Sport.
<br/><br/>"There were times when she stayed overnight at my place after late training sessions, and after dinner she remained engrossed in football-related content on the internet."
<br/>The obsession did not translate into instant success. When Lluis Cortes was appointed manager of Barcelona in 2019, the 21-year-old Bonmati was a fringe player.
<br/><br/>"Aitana is a very ambitious player who always wants to play and be important, and that role was proving to be challenging for her," admitted Cortes of Bonmati's bit-part presence in the team.
However, Cortes, who knew the midfielder from working with the Catalan 'national' team, was soon won over by her determination and quality.
<br/><br/>"She's a player who gives her all in every training session, and through that she has undoubtedly secured her place in the first team," he added.
<br/><br/>Bonmati has since emerged as a key player in Barcelona's midfield, winning four successive domestic titles and two Champions Leagues.
Bonmati's importance for club and country increased after Alexia Putellas, her predecessor as the Ballon d'Or winner, suffered a knee ligament injury in 2022.
